<h1>Expense Tracker App</h1>
This is a simple Expense Tracker web application built using React.js. The app allows users to track their income and expenses, view their balance, and add new transactions.

Features
<ul>
<li>Header: The app features a header component that displays the title of the application.</li>

<li>Balance: Users can see their current balance, which is updated based on their income and expense transactions.</li>

<li>Income and Expense: The IncomeExpense component displays the total income and total expenses separately, helping users to keep track of their financial activity.</li>

<li>Transaction History: Users can view a list of their past transactions, including the description and amount. Transactions are color-coded, making it easy to distinguish between income and expenses.</li>

<li>New Transaction: Users can add new transactions by providing a description and the transaction amount. They can specify whether it's income or an expense. Transactions are dynamically updated in the history and balance sections.</li>
</ul>



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
